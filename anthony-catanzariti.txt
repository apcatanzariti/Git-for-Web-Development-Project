Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
Block elements take up their own line (<div>) and inline elements (<span>) do not.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
It will follow the position you indicated regardless of screen size, orientation, etc.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
by using flex-basis?
 
4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
Display block: <div>, <section>, <p>
Display inline: <span>, <a>
Display inline block: <button>, <img>

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given
 them?
The box model is the model that governs the space that elements occupy. There is padding, border, and margin and each is set to 0 by default, but can be manipulated through CSS. The "fix" seems to be
flex box but I do not have much experience with it. I have used floats and clears in the past when designing web pages but it seems like flex box may be a more elegant solution and works well if the
device the user is viewing the webpage on is flipped to a different orientation (landscape vs. portrait).
